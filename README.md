## Step 1: I found the method used to encode the message (ASCII variation on Vigenere cipher) hidden on the site. 
## Step 2: I copied the encoded message and changed it to an array.
## Step 3: I took 3-character blocks and found the shifts that decoded the particular block to "the". I then aplied thesee shifts across the whole message.
